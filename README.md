# Naive Toon Shader
I had built this shader before I knew about Sobel edge detection, or any other proper post-processing edge detection.
The Shader incorporates per-vertex lighting, normal mapping, and normal detection. Normal detection in the direction of the observer is utilized to create the toon shading effect.
